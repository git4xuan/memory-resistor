   abstract = {Virtualization as a platform for resource-intensive applications, such as MapReduce (MR), has been the subject of many studies in the last years, as it has brought benefits such as better manageability, overall resource utilization, security and scalability. Nevertheless, because of the performance overheads, virtualization has traditionally been avoided in computing environments where performance is a critical factor. In this context, container-based virtualization can be considered a lightweight alternative to the traditional hypervisor-based virtualization systems. In fact, there is a trend towards using containers in MR clusters in order to provide resource sharing and performance isolation (e.g., Mesos and YARN). However, there are still no studies evaluating the performance overhead of the current container-based systems and their ability to provide performance isolation when running MR applications. In this work, we conducted experiments to effectively compare and contrast the current container-based systems (Linux VServer, OpenVZ and Linux Containers (LXC)) in terms of performance and manageability when running on MR clusters. Our results showed that although all container-based systems reach a near-native performance for MapReduce workloads, LXC is the one that offers the best relationship between performance and management capabilities (specially regarding to performance isolation).},

   abstract = {The copy-on-write update policy is a powerful technique for data protection. Unfortunately, it introduces a recursive update problem, which causes several side effects to a storage system, such as WRITE amplification and performance degradation. This paper elaborates on how these effects are introduced by recursive update and how serious they are. In order to evaluate these effects, an extended BTRFS (the Linux B-tree Filesystem) prototype was developed to implement the update-in-place update policy for comparison. This paper reports that recursive update can lead to 29.5x WRITE amplification and 71% performance degradation in a single WRITE operation, as well as 18.3x WRITE amplification and 33% performance degradation in an e-mail server workload. These results indicate that taking recursive update into consideration is important in developing high performance and reliable file and storage systems.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we design a storage system consisting of Nonvolatile DIMMs (as NVRAM) and NAND-flash SSD. We propose a file system NVMFS to exploit the unique characteristics of these devices which simplifies and speeds up file system operations. We use the higher performance NVRAM as both a cache and permanent space for data. Hot data can be permanently stored on NVRAM without writing back to SSD, while relatively cold data can be temporarily cached by NVRAM with another copy on SSD. We also reduce the erase overhead of SSD by reorganizing writes on NVRAM before flushing to SSD. We have implemented a prototype NVMFS within a Linux Kernel and compared with several modern file systems such as ext3, btrfs and NILFS2. We also compared with another hybrid file system Conquest, which originally was designed for NVRAM and HDD. The experimental results show that NVMFS improves IO throughput by an average of 98.9% when segment cleaning is not active, while improves throughput by an average of 19.6% under high disk utilization (over 85%) compared to other file systems. We also show that our file system can reduce the erase operations and overheads at SSD.},

   abstract = {As more scientific workloads are moved into the cloud, the need for high performance accelerators increases. Accelerators such as GPUs offer improvements in both performance and power efficiency over traditional multi-core processors, however, their use in the cloud has been limited. Today, several common hypervisors support GPU passthrough, but their performance has not been systematically characterized. In this paper we show that low overhead GPU passthrough is achievable across 4 major hypervisors and two processor microarchitectures. We compare the performance of two generations of NVIDIA GPUs within the Xen, VMWare ESXi, and KVM hypervisors, and we also compare the performance to that of Linux Containers (LXC). We show that GPU passthrough to KVM achieves 98 -- 100% of the base system's performance across two architectures, while Xen and VMWare achieve 96 -- 99% of the base systems performance, respectively. In addition, we describe several valuable lessons learned through our analysis and share the advantages and disadvantages of each hypervisor/GPU passthrough solution.},
